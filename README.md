# Vintage Tweaks

Tweaks and changes I thought would be nice to see in **Vintage Story**.
All **fully optional** in the config, so you can turn off anything you don’t like.
More features will be implemented as I come across new ideas!

## Current Features

### Middle Click Sort
- Middle click any slot in a your own backpack or a placed inventory and it will be **sorted**.

### Press Z to Zoom
- Choose a keybind in settings then enjoy the power of squinting! 
- A customizable **small zoom** that helps you see things a little better.

### Quick Crates
- **Shift/Control + Right Click** on a crate twice (in quick succession) to:
  - **Quick stack** items into crates.
  - **Quick remove** items from crates.

## Notes

### Version Note
I always suggest using the **latest version of the mod** for your game version unless otherwise specified.  

### Compatibility Note
If you have a mod that changes the number of **backpack slots**, please update the config’s `BackpackSlots` setting to match.  
*(I hope to have this handled automatically in the future.)*
